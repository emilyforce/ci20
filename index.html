         Don't you ever see my blooms?<br>
         On the radio it's call the color of the sun<br>
         You're a celebrity and you're a celebrity<br>

         But I'm looking for a friend of mine<br>
         That's when I look inside my eyes<br>
         It's like rain, la...<br><br>
         It's a crime, la...<br><br>
         It's a time of grace, a seed, a flame<br>
